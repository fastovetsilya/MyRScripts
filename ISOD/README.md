## ISOD algorithm for estimating the balance of nutrients in plants 

The method was originally developed by I.I. Elnikov in Dokuchaev Soil Science Institute (Moscow, Russia) and was written by me in R from his publications and personal conversations with the author. The idea of the method is to estimate the effect each element has in the balance of nutrients in plants and identify the 'weak' nutrient elements. This method is called ISOD and was widely used in the scientific research in agricultural chemistry. However, no references in English are available. 

The source code for the algorithm is in ISOD.R file.
