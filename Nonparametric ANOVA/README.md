## Kruskal-Wallis pre-coded nonparametric AMOVA

The algorithm was originally developed for nonparametric ANOVA for elemental analysis of samples for soil science applications.
This algorithm computes KW tests and creates pictures of them.
The input is an Excel file with columns as variables in mainwd dir.
The grouping variable must be named 'Group'.
The mainwd dir may be changed.
The algorithm by default ignores columns with all missing values.
The algorithm also computes the table of descriptives statistics.
